# Common Design Principles

This directory describes concepts shared across all cloud providers.

- Logical "instances" instead of provider-specific resources
- No SSH access
- IAM-first access model
- Separate state per cloud
- No shared Terraform state across providers

This folder intentionally contains no Terraform code.
